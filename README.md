# OrbisWPS : Open-source Web Processing Service (WPS) libraries. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/orbisgis/orbiswps.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/orbisgis/orbiswps)


OrbisWPS contains a set of OSGI libraries to build a Web Processing Service [(WPS)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps) 
compliant with the 2.0 specification.
OrbisWPS is developed by the GIS team of the  [Lab-STICC](http://www.lab-sticc.fr/en/index/) laboratory, located in Vannes.
It has been supported by research projects:

- [MapUCE](http://www.agence-nationale-recherche.fr/?Projet=ANR-13-VBDU-0004) (Modeling and urbAn Planning laws: Urban 
Climate and Energy, 2014-2018),  ANR Programme: Villes et Bâtiments Durables (VBD) 2013

- [ENERGIC-OD](https://www.energic-od.eu/) Project (European Network for Redistributing Geospatial Information to user 
Communities - Open Data; 2014-2017) partially funded under the ICT Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP) as part of the 
Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme by the European Community and the French geographic portal 
[GEOPAL](http://www.geopal.org) of the Pays de la Loire region.

- [PAENDORA](http://www.ademe.fr/) (Planification, Adaptation et Energie des DOnnées territoriales et Accompagnement, 2017-2020),  ADEME Programme: MODEVAL-URBA 2017

- [URCLIM](http://jpi-climate.eu/nl/25223460-URCLIM.html) (URban CLIMate services, 2017-2020),  JPI Climate Programme

As part of the OrbisGIS platform, OrbisWPS is funded and maintained by personal resources of the Lab-STICC GIS team.

## Groovy API
API for the [Groovy language](www.groovy-lang.org) to write WPS scripts. This module contains the declaration of 
annotations based on the WPS 2.0 standard. The script writing is done in two parts : the input/output declarations and 
the process itself.

The input and output declaration is done by annotated all the variable with `@...Input` or `@...Output`, 
with `...` replaced by the data type. As example :
``` java
@EnumerationInput( title = "title", values = ["round", "flat", "butt", "square"])
String[] enumeration

@LiteralDataInput(title = "title)
String string

@LiteralDataOutput(title = "title)
Long number
```
The available data type are : 
- LiteralData : String and Number like int, long, short ...
- BoundingBox : String representation of a bounding box with the pattern : `authority:code`, like `EPSG:2000`.
- ComplexData extensions :
    - Enumeration : String array representation of a selection of values from a predefined list.
    - Geometry : String representation of a geometry in [WKT](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text).
    - JDBCTable : String representation of a JDBC table.
    - JDBCColumn : String representation of a column of a JDBC table.
    - JDBCValue : String representation of a value of a column of a JDBC table.
    - Password : String representation of secret String.
    - RawData : String representation of a file or forlder, not atter its extension.
    
The process itself is written inside a method called `processing()` (the name can't be changed) annotated `@Process`.

## Scripts
This module contains basic WPS scripts and are loaded in the WPS server by the class `WpsScriptPlugin` thanks to the 
OSGI mechanism.

## Server module
This module contains the whole WPS mechanism which can be divided into two part : the script parsing and the WPS 
request execution. The WPS service can be customized by instantiating the `WpsServerImpl` class with a customized 
version of the [properties file](https://github.com/orbisgis/orbiswps/blob/master/server/src/main/resources/org/orbisgis/orbiswps/service/utils/basicWpsServer.properties)

### Script parsing
The script parsing is done in 3 steps :
- The script parsing is based on the Groovy parser which convert the groovy files into java classes.
- Then those classes are inspected to search for the groovy annotations defined in the Groovy-API module and to 
generate the JAVA object representation of the process. A part of the model comes from the JAXB generated classes from 
the [ogc-custom-jaxb](https://github.com/orbisgis/ogc-custom-jaxb) library and the model package of the module (package containing the custom extension of the ComplexDataType class).
- To finish the Java object are stored into a cache list and becomes available throw the service.

### WPS request execution
The process execution is done by the `WpsServerImpl.callOperation()` method which receive an `InputStream` object 
containing the WPS 2.0 request.

The request is then parsed and executed. In the case of the `Execute` request, an instance of the java class of the 
desired script is instantiated and configured with the input. Then the method `processing()` is executed. Once the 
execution end reached, the output data a retrieved.

## Client
API interface and classes for the creation of a WPS client compatible with the server.
